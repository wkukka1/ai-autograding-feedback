Consider this question:
{context}

{submission_image}

Do the graphs in the attached {image_size} image solve the problem? Respond with a JSON array of objects, where each object contains `description`, a description of the problem, and `location`, the location of the issue in the image as a bounding box in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format. Do not include ```json ``` in the responses.
