Categorize each of the student's errors and then explain the reason for the error. Use this template: Error Type: [e.g., Logic Error, Syntax Error, Data Type Mismatch, etc] Description: [Explain why the error falls into this category] Solution: [How to resolve the issue]. If possible, identify the root causes of errors that lead to further issues later in the code. Prioritize fixing the earliest instances where the code breaks to prevent cascading failures.
