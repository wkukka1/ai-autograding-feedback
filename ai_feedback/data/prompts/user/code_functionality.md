CONTEXT
- File reference: {file_references}
- File contents: {file_contents}

If something has been submitted, do the following:

1. Pay attention to variable initialization. Even if a variable is later overwritten (e.g., by a `scanf`), students are required to assign an initial value.
2. Identify the underlying logical errors in the student's code and explain **why** these errors occur. Provide context to help the student understand the principles behind the error.
3. Create at least five test cases, including normal, edge, and invalid inputs. Simulate the execution of the code, comparing expected vs. observed outputs for each case.
4. Explain **how** the student's logic leads to errors or failures, rather than just pointing out the mistake. Use detailed reasoning to help the student learn from the issue.
5. Provide actionable feedback. Suggest improvements in a way that helps the student understand the solution without directly giving it away.

Reflexion / Self-Critique
