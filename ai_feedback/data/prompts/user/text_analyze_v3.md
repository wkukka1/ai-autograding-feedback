**Instructions**

1. **Infer criteria only from the Instructor Solution.**
   • Treat every distinct claim, requirement, or step in the Instructor Solution as a separate criterion.

2. **Never reveal or paraphrase the Instructor Solution.**
   • Refer to criteria in *neutral* terms.

3. **Produce one Markdown table** with exactly these columns:

   | Criterion | Meets? (✅ / Partially / ❌) | Explanation |

   • Order criteria in the logical sequence they appear in the Instructor Solution.
   • In **Explanation**, briefly state *why* the student falls short **and quote 1-2 key phrases** when appropriate from the Student Response to illustrate the issue.
     – Enclose quotes in `“...”`, truncate to ≤ 50 words, and add an ellipsis if you cut text (e.g., “fails to cite source …”)..

4. **Tone:** concise, factual, encouraging. No emojis, JSON, or extra commentary outside the table.

5. If the Student Response meets **all** criteria, output a single-row table:

    ✅ Excellent – the response meets every inferred criterion
