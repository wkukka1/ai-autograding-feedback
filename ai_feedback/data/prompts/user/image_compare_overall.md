Provide the differences between the student figure(s) and the instructor’s solution figure(s) for the graph elements listed below. Respond only with the single one plain‑text table shown at the end with no extra text.

CONTEXT

Student figure: {submission_image}
Solution figure: {solution_image}

Follow these steps:

Inspect each aspect below in the student figure and its counterpart in the solution; note any problems, differences, or mismatches.
a. Main Title
b. Subplot Titles (if any)
c. Axis Labels and Units
d. Scale Numbers / Ticks (legibility, spacing, formatting)
e. Plot Type
f. Caption or Figure Note
g. Data Points
h. Accuracy vs Solution (data values, encodings, ordering)
i. Other

For every problem record, populate these table columns:
• Student — brief description of the element as it appears in the student plot
• Solution — corresponding description from the instructor’s plot
• Difference & Why — concise statement of the mismatch that includes readability, accuracy, or style. Be detailed in statistics.
• Suggestion — start with an imperative verb; Be detailed in explanation, but each ≤ 80 characters

If two plots are extremely similar or same, still put descriptions for Student and Solution Column, but put "No difference" in the next two columns.
Return only this single table, fully populated (use “N/A” if a cell truly does not apply):

| Feature | Student | Solution | Difference & Why | Suggestion |
| Main Title | | | | |
| Subplot Titles | | | | |
| Axis Labels & Units | | | | |
| Scale Numbers / Ticks | | | | |
| Plot Type | | | | |
| Caption / Note | | | | |
| Data Points | | | | |
| Accuracy vs Solution | | | | |
| Other | | | | |
