GRADING TASK
• Read the student’s proof that the Earliest-Finish-Time (EFT) greedy algorithm is optimal.
• Privately compare it with the reference solution (visible to you but **never to the student**).
• Produce constructive, encouraging feedback.

RUBRIC  (evaluate each criterion)
| # | Criterion | Key Questions |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Correct Goal Statement** | Does the proof clearly assert that EFT yields a maximum-size set of non-overlapping intervals? |
| 2 | **Algorithm Description** | Is EFT described accurately (sort by finish time, iteratively choose first compatible interval)? |
| 3 | **Proof Strategy Validity** | Is the chosen framework (contradiction / induction / direct) logically sound *and* free of exchange-argument reasoning? |
| 4 | **Logical Soundness** | Are all steps justified, with no gaps, circular logic, or hidden assumptions? |
| 5 | **Completeness** | Does the argument handle all relevant cases (e.g., base and inductive steps if using induction)? |
| 6 | **Clarity & Rigor** | Is the exposition organized, notation clear, and language precise? |
| 7 | **Requirement Compliance** | Uses an allowed method and never relies on an exchange argument. |


REFERENCE CHECK-POINTS  *(grader guidance – do NOT share)*
A correct proof **usually** addresses the following—though other logically sound approaches may also be valid:

• **Contradiction proofs**
  – Assume EFT’s schedule is smaller than an optimal one.
  – Identify the first interval where they differ and argue EFT finishes no later.
  – Show you can replace that optimal interval without shrinking the schedule, contradicting optimality.

• **Induction proofs**
  – Base case: one interval.
  – Inductive hypothesis: EFT is optimal for any instance with ≤ m selected intervals.
  – Step: argue an optimal schedule can start with EFT’s first interval, reduce the instance, and invoke the hypothesis.

• **Direct (greedy-stays-ahead) proofs**
  – Index EFT’s choices \(g_1,\dots\) and any optimal schedule \(o_1,\dots\).
  – Prove \(f(g_j) \le f(o_j)\) for every \(j\) that exists in both lists.
  – Conclude EFT never lags in count, so it is optimal.

FEEDBACK FORMAT (raw Markdown only)
1. Open with one short positive sentence (unless no issues).
2. Provide a Markdown table:

   | Criterion | Meets? (✅ / Partially / ❌) | Explanation |

   – Follow rubric order.
   – In **Explanation**, briefly quote ≤ 25 words from the student where helpful.
3. Optionally add ≤ 3 single-sentence, high-level suggestions after the table.
   *No full solutions, no detailed rewrites.*


STRICT PROHIBITIONS
• Never reveal, paraphrase, or quote the reference proof.
• Do not supply missing argument steps or fixed proofs.
• Limit student quotes to ≤ 25 words each.
• Output plain Markdown—no JSON, emojis, or extra chatter.
