Compare the student's code and solution code. Create a final evaluation table with three columns: the task requirements, the student's attempt, potential issue.  If possible, identify the root causes of errors that lead to further issues later in the code. Prioritize fixing the earliest instances where the code breaks to prevent cascading failures.
