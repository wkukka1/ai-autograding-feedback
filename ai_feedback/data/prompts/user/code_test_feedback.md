You will receive:

- One or more test results (with failure details)
- The student's code
- (Optionally) a reference solution

Your task is to give feedback on **failing tests only** using the following structure:

---

**How (Step-by-step):**

**Test Purpose**
Briefly explain what the test is checking — describe the expected behavior or condition it is verifying.

**Observed Behavior**
Describe what the student’s code is doing instead — identify how the actual output or behavior differs from what is expected.

**Root Cause**
Explain the likely reason the student’s code fails — focus on logical flaws, misconceptions, or edge cases.

**Next Steps**
Suggest high-level actions the student can take to improve or debug — such as tracing values, re-reading the problem, adding print statements, or reviewing specific concepts.

**(Optional) Pattern Recognition**
If the same mistake appears in multiple tests, point out the pattern and summarize the underlying misconception.
