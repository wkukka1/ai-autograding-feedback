## `correctness_submission.java`

### Submission Summary

This is a partial implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing integers. While the structure is mostly correct, the `deleteRoot()` method contains **critical logical and syntax errors** that would prevent the code from compiling or behaving correctly.

```java
private void deleteRoot() {
    if (this.left.isEmpty() && this.right.isEmpty()) {
        this.root = null;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    } else if (this.left.isEmpty()) {
        this.right = this.right.right;
    } else (this.right.isEmpty()) {
        this.right = this.left.right;
    }
}
```

### Issues Identified

- **Syntax error**: `else (this.right.isEmpty())` is invalid Java. It should be `else if`.
- **Incorrect reassignment logic**:
  - In `else if (this.left.isEmpty())`, the node’s root and structure are **not updated** properly. Only `this.right` is reassigned to `this.right.right`, which **loses the current root value** and breaks BST invariants.
  - In `else if (this.right.isEmpty())`, the same problem occurs with `this.right = this.left.right` — the root and left subtree are **ignored**.
- No handling for the **two-child case**, which is essential in a correct `deleteRoot()` implementation.
- Constructors and structure are otherwise reasonable for a minimal recursive BST.

### Expected AI Response

- Identify the **syntax error** on the `else` line and explain how to correct it.
- Recognize that both conditional branches in `deleteRoot()` fail to update the root node or maintain BST structure.
- Mention the absence of a two-child deletion case.
- Suggest:
  - Fixing `else if` syntax.
  - Updating the root properly when one child is empty.
  - Implementing correct logic for two-child deletion (e.g., replace root with in-order predecessor or successor).
