## Task 1

a) Use the `pandas` method `read_csv` to read the file `gss_tu2016_main_file.csv` into a DataFrame.  Store this DataFrame in a variable called `time_use_df`.

Code Cell:
import pandas as pd

time_use_df = pd.read_csv('gss_tu2016_main_file.csv')

Markdown Cell:
b) Create a subset of `time_use_df` with only the following columns: `dur41, dur47, agegr10, prv`.  To do this follow these steps:

- Create a list called `analysis_columns` with the column names.
- Use `analysis_columns` to select these columns from `time_use_df` and store this DataFrame in a variable called `time_use_subset_df`.

Code Cell:
analysis_columns = ['dur41', 'dur47', 'sleepdur', 'agegr10', 'prv']

time_use_subset_df = time_use_df[analysis_columns]

time_use_subset_df

Markdown Cell:
c) In the next steps you will rename the columns of `time_use_subset_df` according to the following table:

Old name | New name
---------|------------
`dur41`  |`Socializing time`
`dur47`  |`Exercising time`
`sleepdur`| `Sleep time`
`agegr10`|`Age group`
`prv`    |`Province`

Step 1: Create a dictionary called `new_col_names` with each *Old name* as a key and each *New name* as the corresponding value.

Code Cell:
new_col_names = {
    'dur41': 'Socializing time',
    'dur47': 'Exercising time',
    'sleepdur': 'Sleep time',
    'agegr10': 'Age group',
    'prv': 'Province'
}

new_col_names

Markdown Cell:
Step 2: Use `new_col_names` to rename the columns of `time_use_subset_df` and store the DataFrame with renamed columns in a variable called `time_use_subset_renamed_df`.

Code Cell:
time_use_subset_renamed_df = time_use_subset_df.rename(columns=new_col_names)

time_use_subset_renamed_df


Markdown Cell:
## Task 2

Create columns in `time_use_subset_renamed_df` that converts time use from minutes to hours.  Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour we can divide the time use columns by 60 to compute the time in hours.

To do this create new columns in `time_use_subset_renamed_df` called

  + `Socializing time (hour)`,
  + `Exercising time (hour)`, and
  + `Sleep time (hour)`

these columns are (respectively) `Socializing time`, `Exercising time`, and `Sleep time` in hours.

Code Cell:
time_use_subset_renamed_df['Socializing time (hour)'] = time_use_subset_renamed_df['Socializing time'] / 60

time_use_subset_renamed_df['Exercising time (hour)'] = time_use_subset_renamed_df['Exercising time'] / 60

time_use_subset_renamed_df['Sleep time (hour)'] = time_use_subset_renamed_df['Sleep time'] / 60

time_use_subset_renamed_df

Markdown Cell:
## Task 3

Some respondents in the time use survey spent no time exercising, socializing, and sleeping.  In this section we will create a DataFrame that only has respondents who spent time sleeping, exercising, and socializing.  In other words respondents that spent no time on these activities will be excluded.

a) Create a boolean Series called `well_balanced` that is `True` if time spent exercising **and** time spent sleeping **and** time spent socializing are all greater than 0, and `False` otherwise.

Code Cell:
well_balanced = (
    (time_use_subset_renamed_df['Sleep time (hour)'] > 0) &
    (time_use_subset_renamed_df['Exercising time (hour)'] > 0) &
    (time_use_subset_renamed_df['Socializing time (hour)'] > 0)
)

Markdown Cell:
b) Use `well_balanced` to filter (i.e. select) the rows of `time_use_subset_renamed_df` where respondents had non-zero times of sleeping, exercising, and socializing.  Store this filtered DataFrame in `well_balanced_df`.

Code Cell:
well_balanced_df = time_use_subset_renamed_df[well_balanced]

well_balanced_df

Markdown Cell:
c) The number of rows in a `pandas` DataFrame can be computed by `len()`.  For example, `len(well_balanced_df)` is the number of rows in `well_balanced_df`.  Compute the number of respondents who were *removed* from `time_use_subset_renamed_df` when it was filtered using `well_balanced` and store this number in a variable called `diff`.

Code Cell:
diff = len(time_use_subset_renamed_df) - len(well_balanced_df)

diff

Markdown Cell:
d) Use `diff` to compute the percentage of respondents removed from `time_use_subset_renamed_df`. Round the percentage to two decimal places, and store the result value in a variable called `pct_lost`.

Code Cell:
pct_lost = round(diff/len(time_use_subset_renamed_df) * 100, 2)

pct_lost

Markdown Cell:
## Task 4

In this section you will explore the distributions of time spent socializing, exercising, and sleeping by age group and province.

a) Compute the mean hours spent sleeping, socializing, and exercising by age group using `.groupby` on `well_balanced_df`.  Store this DataFrame in a variable called `group_means`.

b) Create a new column in `group_means` called `Total time (hour)` that is the sum of the time (in hours) spent sleeping, exercising, and socializing.

c) Create a new index for `group_means` using the labels of Age group found in the code book (`gss_tu2016_codebook.txt`) and store the values in a list called `index_new`.

d) Change the index of `group_means` to correspond to `index_new`.

Code Cell:
group_means = well_balanced_df.groupby('Age group')[['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)','Sleep time (hour)']].mean()

group_means['Total time (hour)'] = group_means.sum(axis=1)

index_new = ['15-24','25-34', '35-44','45-54','55-64','65-74', '75+']

group_means.index = index_new


# Display group_means to check that the index has been updated.
# On the left-hand side you should see the Age group labels, from "15-24" to "75+".
group_means

Markdown Cell:
e) Sort `group_means` in descending order of `Total time (hour)`.  Store this sorted DataFrame in a variable called `group_means_sorted`


Code Cell:
group_means_sorted = group_means.sort_values(by='Total time (hour)', ascending=False)

group_means_sorted


Markdown Cell:
f) Use `well_balanced_df` to create three side-by-side boxplots of time spent (in hours) socializing, exercising, and sleeping for each age group. Store these boxplots in a variable called `time_boxplots`.

Code Cell:
time_boxplots = well_balanced_df.boxplot(column=['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)','Sleep time (hour)'], by='Age group', figsize=(10, 10))

Markdown Cell:
## Task 5

The tick marks on the horizontal axes of `time_boxplots` are not informative unless the viewer knows which age group each value represents.  Fix labels of boxplot by recoding `Age group` using the labels in the code book (see `gss_tu2016_codebook.txt`).

a) First, create a copy of `well_balanced_df` (using the DataFrame `.copy()` method), and store it in a variable called `well_balanced_age_label_df`. For that new DataFrame, recode `Age group` by adding a column called `Age group label` with the Age group labels found in the code book.

Code Cell:
well_balanced_age_label_df = well_balanced_df.copy()

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 1, 'Age group label'] = '15-24'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 2, 'Age group label'] = '25-34'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 3, 'Age group label'] = '35-44'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 4, 'Age group label'] = '45-54'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 5, 'Age group label'] = '55-64'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 6, 'Age group label'] = '65-74'

well_balanced_age_label_df.loc[well_balanced_age_label_df['Age group'] == 7, 'Age group label'] = '75+'

well_balanced_age_label_df

Markdown Cell:
b) Create the same boxplots as in Task 4 f), but use `Age group label` to create the boxplot, so that the ticks on horizontal axes of the boxplot are informative. Store this boxplot in a variable called `time_boxplots_age_label`.

Code Cell:
time_boxplots_age_label = well_balanced_age_label_df.boxplot(column=['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)', 'Sleep time (hour)'], by='Age group label', figsize=(10, 10))

Markdown Cell:
## Task 6 (Written Discussion)

a) Which age group spends the most time sleeping, exercising, and socializing?  Does your ranking change if you use mean or median as a summary measure of time?  Briefly explain why or why not your ranking changes, and which ranking is the best representation.

b) Which age group shows the most variability in time spent socializing?  Provide a brief explanation of why this group shows the most variability.

c) State one limitations of basing this data analysis on only respondents that spent more than zero time sleeping, exercising, and socializing.  Briefly explain why it's a limitation to your findings in Tasks 4 and 5.

Markdown Cell:
*Sample solutions*

a)
- yes the rankings change for the total if the mean or median is used.
- if the median is used then the rankings are: 15-24, 25-34, 75+ ,...
- if the mean is used then the rankings are: 15-25, 75+, 55-64, ...
- There are outliers in sleep and socializing that we can see on the boxplots that are pushing the mean higher, but the median is not influenced by these observations.
- The best representation is the median since it's not influenced by outliers.

b) the length of the boxplot is longest for 15-24 age group.

c) 96% of the data is excluded so results might be different if these observations are included.
