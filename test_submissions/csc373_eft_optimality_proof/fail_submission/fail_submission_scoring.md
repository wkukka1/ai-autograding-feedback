### Submission Summary

This proof lacks formal structure and relies on circular reasoning:

```latex
The greedy algorithm picks the best interval at each step, so it must be the optimal solution.

It sorts by finish time, and always chooses the earliest one, which is the most efficient. If it was not optimal, that would mean it missed a better interval, but it always picks the best.

Therefore, it is optimal.
```
## Issues Identified

- No definition of optimality or contradiction.
- Assumes what it is trying to prove.
- Offers no structural or mathematical reasoning.

### Expected AI Response

- Identify circular logic.
- Point out lack of definitions or contradiction structure.
- Recommend explicitly comparing greedy and optimal solutions.
