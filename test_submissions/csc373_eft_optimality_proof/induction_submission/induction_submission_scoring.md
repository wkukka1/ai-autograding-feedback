#### Submission Summary

Uses a clean induction argument to show the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution:

```latex
Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\}$ be the set selected by the EFT algorithm.

We prove by induction that $A$ is of maximum size.

\textbf{Base case ($k = 1$):} The first interval finishes earliest among all, and is thus compatible with the most remaining time. No larger compatible subset can start before it finishes.

\textbf{Inductive step:} Assume the algorithm produces an optimal set of size $k-1$.

Let $a_k$ be the $k$-th greedy interval, and suppose an optimal solution $O$ has $k$ non-overlapping intervals.

At step $k$, the greedy choice $a_k$ has the earliest finish time among intervals that donâ€™t overlap with $a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}$. Let $o_k$ be the corresponding $k$-th interval in $O$.

We consider two cases:

- If $o_k$ starts after $a_{k-1}$, then $f(a_k) \le f(o_k)$, so $a_k$ is at least as good as $o_k$.
- If $o_k$ overlaps with $a_{k-1}$, it couldn't be selected anyway.

Thus, $A$ fits $k$ compatible intervals, matching $O$. So $A$ is optimal.
```
## Issues Identified

- Clearly structured.
- Justifies steps with finish-time comparisons.
- Avoids exchange argument and builds up logically.

#### Expected AI Response

- Recognize the use of induction and structural reasoning.
- Confirm logical correctness and completeness.
- Praise clarity and formality.
