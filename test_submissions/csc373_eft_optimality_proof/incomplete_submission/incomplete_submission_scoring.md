### Submission Summary

This submission starts a contradiction argument but skips a critical justification step:

```latex
Let $A$ be the set of intervals chosen by the greedy algorithm. Assume for contradiction that there exists another set $O$ with more non-overlapping intervals.

The greedy algorithm always picks the interval with the earliest finish time. This ensures that we leave the maximum possible room for the rest of the intervals.

So every interval in $A$ finishes before or at the same time as the corresponding interval in $O$. Hence, $A$ should be able to contain at least as many intervals as $O$.

Therefore, the greedy algorithm is optimal.
```
## Issues Identified

- Assumes a one-to-one correspondence between $A$ and $O$ without justification.
- Fails to show that greedy's early finishes actually allow inclusion of $k$ intervals.
- Contradiction is stated but not completed rigorously.

### Expected AI Response

- Acknowledge the correct overall structure.
- Highlight the unjustified assumption of alignment between $A$ and $O$.
- Recommend explicitly showing how EFT's earliest-finish choice leads to no worse than optimal.
