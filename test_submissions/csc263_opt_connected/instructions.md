
## Task: BFS Connectivity Check on Complete Graph

---

### Problem Summary

Modify the standard BFS algorithm to determine if an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges is connected in
`O(n + m)` time. However, when the input is a complete graph `Kₙ`, the algorithm should run in `Θ(n)` time.

> Only provide code modifications to the standard BFS.
