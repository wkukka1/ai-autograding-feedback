## `fail_submission.py`

### Submission Summary

This implementation assumes that if every node has edges, the graph must be connected:

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    for node in graph:
        if len(graph[node]) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
## Issues Identified

- This does not traverse the graph or check if all nodes are reachable from a source. It would incorrectly return `True` for disconnected graphs where all nodes have at least one edge.

### Expected AI Response

- Identify that the algorithm does not perform any traversal (e.g., BFS or DFS).
- Point out that simply checking for non-empty adjacency lists does not verify connectivity.
- Suggest implementing BFS to ensure all nodes can be visited from a starting node.
- Emphasize the need for a visited set and traversal logic.
