## `style_issues_submission.py`

### Submission Summary

The logic is correct, but the code suffers from inefficiencies and style concerns:

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    visited = {}
    for i in range(len(graph)):
        visited[i] = False

    queue = []
    queue.append(0)
    visited[0] = True

    while len(queue) > 0:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if visited[neighbor] == False:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)

    for node in visited:
        if visited[node] == False:
            return False
    return True
```

## Issues Identified

- Uses a dictionary instead of a boolean list for `visited`.
- Contains verbose conditionals like `== False`.

### Expected AI Response

- Acknowledge that the implementation is functionally correct.
- Recommend simplifying logic using lists and direct truthy checks (e.g., `if not visited[i]`).
- Suggest replacing `while len(queue) > 0` with `while queue`.
