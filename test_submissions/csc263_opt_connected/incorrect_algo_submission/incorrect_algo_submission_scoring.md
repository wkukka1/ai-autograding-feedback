## `incorrect_algo_submission.py`

### Submission Summary

This version uses a depth-first search (DFS) instead of the required breadth-first search (BFS):

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    visited = set()
    def dfs(u):
        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                dfs(v)
    dfs(0)
    return len(visited) == len(graph)
```
## Issues Identified

- While it correctly checks connectivity, it does not follow the instructions to use BFS.

### Expected AI Response

- Note that the submission uses DFS instead of BFS, which violates the question's requirements.
- Acknowledge that the solution is correct in logic and time complexity.
- Suggest changing the traversal to BFS.
