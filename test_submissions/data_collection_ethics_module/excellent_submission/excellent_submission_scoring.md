### Submission Summary

This student offers a clear, well-structured, and thoroughly justified argument, grounded in ethical theory and concrete examples. The response opens with a precise thesis, moves through principled reasoning and real-world harms, acknowledges counterarguments, and concludes with actionable recommendations.

> **Student Submission:**
> It is not ethically acceptable to use social media data without explicit, informed consent—even if that data is publicly accessible. Public availability does not equate to moral permission; users often do not anticipate that their posts or photos will be harvested to train opaque AI systems.
>
> From a **deontological perspective**, individuals possess an inalienable right to privacy and digital autonomy, which demands clear, opt-in consent before repurposing their content. From a **utilitarian standpoint**, while large datasets can accelerate innovation, the potential harms—such as algorithmic bias, reputational damage, and psychological distress—often outweigh the aggregate benefits when safeguards are absent.
>
> For example, facial recognition models trained on scraped images have disproportionately misidentified people of color, leading to wrongful arrests and the perpetuation of systemic injustice. To mitigate these risks, companies should:
> 1. **Implement transparent opt-in mechanisms** that clearly explain how data will be used.
> 2. **Anonymize or limit sensitive attributes** to minimize re-identification.
> 3. **Conduct regular ethical impact assessments** and publish their findings.
>
> **Opposing viewpoints** argue that “public posting implies consent” or that “the societal benefits of AI outweigh individual concerns.” However, treating users merely as means to an end erodes trust, violates respect for persons, and may produce long-term backlash that undermines both innovation and social welfare.
>
> **Conclusion:** Ethical data use requires more than legal compliance—it demands transparency, accountability, and respect for each person’s digital autonomy.

### Expected AI Response

- Notes the explicit stance against unconsented use of public data.
- Highlights invocation of deontological rights and utilitarian cost-benefit analysis.
- Emphasizes that public accessibility ≠ informed consent.
- Cites the facial recognition example and concrete strategies (opt-in, anonymization, impact assessments).
- Identifies common counterarguments and provides a rebuttal grounded in ethical theory.
- Acknowledges the clear introduction, body with subpoints, and concise conclusion.
