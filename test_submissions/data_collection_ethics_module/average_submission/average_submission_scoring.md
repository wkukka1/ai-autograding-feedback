### Submission Summary

This student offers a moderately reasoned view that public data can be used for machine-learning when transparency and basic safeguards are in place, but the answer is still thin on rigorous ethical analysis and organisation.

> Collecting data that users have already shared publicly on social media can be acceptable as long as the company is open about what it is doing and gives people a way to opt out. Public posts do lower the expectation of privacy, yet users don’t always realise their pictures or comments might train an AI. Firms should announce the purpose of the scrape, hide personal names, and delete sensitive details. If a model could harm specific groups—say by revealing identities—extra caution is needed. At the same time, big public datasets help algorithms avoid bias and make products that benefit everyone, so completely banning scraping would slow progress. Overall, using public data without individual permission can be ethical when it is clearly disclosed, limited to non-sensitive content, and paired with strong security measures.

### Expected AI Feedback Response Should

* Point out that student gives a good thesis
* Highlight that the answer justifies thesis by stating importance of privacy concerns when it comes to scraping data
* Mention that while acknowledges risks does not justify why their points still stands
* Encourage the student to acknowledge and address counter-arguments to strengthen critical analysis.
