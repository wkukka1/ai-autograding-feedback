### Submission Summary

This response misunderstands or oversimplifies the ethical issue:

> If it’s online, it’s free to use. The internet is public so there’s no reason to ask. Companies can do what they want with public info. People should know better than to post things if they don’t want it used. Ethics doesn’t matter if it’s not illegal. Social media is public space so anything goes.

### Expected AI Response

- Point out failure to distinguish legal from ethical standards.
- Note the lack of ethical reasoning or concern for privacy.
- Recommend reconsidering consent and public vs. private assumptions.
- Suggest basic definitions of ethics and examples of misuse.
