# Correct Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This implementation correctly fulfills all requirements with good practices:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create well-being time use dataset
data = {
    'Age group': ['18-25', '18-25', '26-35', '26-35'],
    'Socializing time (hour)': [2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0],
    'Exercising time (hour)': [1.0, 0.5, 1.2, 1.1],
    'Sleep time (hour)': [7.0, 6.5, 8.0, 7.5]
}
well_balanced_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create comprehensive boxplot showing all time categories by age group
time_boxplots = well_balanced_df.boxplot(
    column=['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)', 'Sleep time (hour)'],
    by='Age group',
    figsize=(10, 10)
)
plt.suptitle('Time Use Patterns by Age Group')
plt.show()
```

## Strengths Identified

1. **Perfect Requirement Compliance**: Creates single figure with all three time categories
2. **Excellent Documentation**: Clear comments explaining data structure and visualization purpose
3. **Professional Presentation**: Includes descriptive title and appropriate figure sizing
4. **Clean Code Structure**: Well-organized imports and logical flow
5. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Uses meaningful names like `well_balanced_df` and `time_boxplots`

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and praise:

- **Requirement fulfillment**: Acknowledge that all specifications are met with single combined visualization
- **Professional quality**: Praise the use of descriptive titles and appropriate figure sizing
- **Code organization**: Recognize clean structure with proper imports and logical flow
- **Documentation quality**: Commend clear comments that explain the analysis purpose
- **Variable naming**: Note the use of descriptive names that enhance code readability

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 100/100** - Perfect implementation of all requirements
- **Style: 95/100** - Excellent code quality and documentation
- **Overall Grade: A+ (98%)**
