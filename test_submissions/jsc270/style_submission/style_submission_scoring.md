# Style Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This implementation creates the required boxplot but has poor coding style and lacks proper documentation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data={'Age group':['18-25','18-25','26-35','26-35'],'Socializing time (hour)':[2.5,3.0,1.5,2.0],'Exercising time (hour)':[1.0,0.5,1.2,1.1],'Sleep time (hour)':[7.0,6.5,8.0,7.5]}
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
df.boxplot(column=['Socializing time (hour)','Exercising time (hour)','Sleep time (hour)'],by='Age group')
plt.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Poor Formatting**: Missing spaces around operators and after commas
2. **Variable Naming**: Generic `df` instead of descriptive name like `well_balanced_df`
3. **Line Length**: Extremely long lines that are hard to read
4. **Missing Documentation**: No comments explaining data structure or visualization purpose
5. **No Figure Enhancement**: Missing title, figure size, or other improvements

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Formatting violations**: Point out missing spaces around operators (`=`, `,`) and poor line structure
- **Variable naming**: Recommend using descriptive names like `time_use_data` or `well_balanced_df`
- **Code readability**: Suggest breaking long lines and adding proper spacing for readability
- **Documentation gaps**: Recommend adding comments to explain the data structure and analysis purpose
- **Visualization enhancement**: Suggest adding figure title and appropriate sizing

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 90/100** - Creates correct boxplot visualization
- **Style: 45/100** - Major formatting and documentation issues
- **Overall Grade: C- (67%)**
