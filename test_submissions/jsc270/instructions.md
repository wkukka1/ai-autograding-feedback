## Introduction

In this homework we explore:
- row, column selection
- create new columns
- grouping
- summary statistics
- visualizing distributions

**Question:** Explore sleeping, exercising, and socializing among Canadians.

### Q1: Create a boxplot for each of the following time-based columns, grouped by `Age group`:
- `Socializing time (hour)`
- `Exercising time (hour)`
- `Sleep time (hour)`

Use one boxplot figure that displays all three columns side-by-side, grouped by age.
