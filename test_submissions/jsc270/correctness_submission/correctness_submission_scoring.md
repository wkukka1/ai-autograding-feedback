# Correctness Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This version has logical errors in meeting the complete requirements:

```python
# Required imports
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    'Age group': ['18-25', '18-25', '26-35', '26-35'],
    'Socializing time (hour)': [2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0],
    'Exercising time (hour)': [1.0, 0.5, 1.2, 1.1],
    'Sleep time (hour)': [7.0, 6.5, 8.0, 7.5]
}
well_balanced_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Boxplot visualization
time_boxplots = well_balanced_df.boxplot(
    column=['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)'],
    by='Age group',
    figsize=(10, 10)
)
plt.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Incomplete Column Selection**: Only plots 2 out of 3 required time categories
2. **Missing Sleep Data**: Fails to include 'Sleep time (hour)' in the visualization
3. **Requirement Violation**: Assignment requires all three time categories in single figure
4. **Partial Task Completion**: Creates functional visualization but misses key data component
5. **Analysis Limitation**: Prevents complete comparison across all wellness indicators

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Missing data category**: Point out that 'Sleep time (hour)' is missing from the column list
- **Incomplete requirement fulfillment**: Explain that all three time categories must be included
- **Easy fix identification**: Note that the data exists but isn't being visualized
- **Completeness emphasis**: Stress the importance of including all required variables in analysis
- **Solution guidance**: Suggest adding 'Sleep time (hour)' to the column list for complete visualization

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 70/100** - Creates proper boxplot but missing one required column
- **Style: 90/100** - Good formatting, comments, and structure
- **Overall Grade: C+ (75%)**
