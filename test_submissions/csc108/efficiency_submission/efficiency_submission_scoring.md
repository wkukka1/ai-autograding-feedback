# Efficiency Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This solution works correctly but has unnecessary computational overhead:

```python
def fizzbuzz(n: int) -> list:
    """
    Generates the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to n.

    For each number in the range 1 to n (inclusive):
    - If divisible by 3, returns 'Fizz'
    - If divisible by 5, returns 'Buzz'
    - If divisible by both 3 and 5, returns 'FizzBuzz'
    - Otherwise, returns the number itself
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        divisible_by_3 = (i % 3 == 0)
        divisible_by_5 = (i % 5 == 0)
        if divisible_by_3 and divisible_by_5:
            result.append('FizzBuzz')
        elif divisible_by_3:
            result.append('Fizz')
        elif divisible_by_5:
            result.append('Buzz')
        else:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Unnecessary Variables**: Creates boolean variables for simple modulo operations
2. **Extra Memory Usage**: Stores intermediate boolean values unnecessarily
3. **Over-Engineering**: Adds complexity without performance benefit
4. **Verbose Approach**: More lines of code than needed for this simple problem

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Unnecessary complexity**: Point out that the boolean variables `divisible_by_3` and `divisible_by_5` are not needed for this simple problem
- **Direct approach recommendation**: Suggest using the modulo operations directly in the conditional statements
- **Acknowledge correctness**: Recognize that the implementation is functionally correct and produces the right output
- **Efficiency guidance**: Explain that while the approach isn't wrong, it adds unnecessary steps for this scale of problem
- **Simplification suggestion**: Show how the code can be simplified by using `if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:` directly

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 100/100** - Algorithm is perfect and handles all cases
- **Style: 80/100** - Good structure but unnecessarily verbose
- **Efficiency: 75/100** - Correct but with unnecessary overhead
- **Overall Grade: B+ (85%)**
