# Style Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This implementation has major style issues and fails to meet assignment requirements:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px




a = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
px.histogram(a, x='view_count', nbins = 50)
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Excessive Empty Lines**: Contains 7 unnecessary blank lines between imports and code execution
2. **Poor Variable Naming**: Uses single letter variable name `a` instead of descriptive name like `sb`
3. **Spacing Issues**: Missing spaces around operators and inconsistent formatting
4. **No Code Documentation**: Lacks any comments explaining the analysis purpose
5. **Missing Display Commands**: No `.show()` calls to actually display the histogram

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Excessive whitespace**: Point out the 7 redundant empty lines that harm code readability
- **Variable naming violations**: Criticize the use of single-letter variable `a` instead of meaningful names
- **Missing output**: Point out that the histogram won't display without `.show()` or similar commands
- **Professional standards**: Emphasize that clean, readable code is essential in data analysis

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 30/100** - missing display commands
- **Style: 25/100** - Multiple major style violations including excessive whitespace and poor naming
- **Overall Grade: F (28%)**
