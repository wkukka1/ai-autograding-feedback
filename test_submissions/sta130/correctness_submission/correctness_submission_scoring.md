# Correctness Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This version has major logical errors and fails to meet core requirements:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
sb = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
# Create a histogram with about 50 bins
fig = px.histogram(sb, x="view_count", nbins=30)
fig.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Bin Count**: Uses 30 bins instead of the specified ~50 bins as mentioned in the comment
2. **Comment-Code Mismatch**: Comment says "about 50 bins" but code uses 30 bins

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Bin count discrepancy**: Note that both the comment indicates 50 bins but code uses 30, neither meeting the requirement

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 25/100** - Major failure to meet core requirements (only 1/3 histograms, wrong bin count)
- **Style: 75/100** - Reasonable formatting but poor commenting accuracy
- **Overall Grade: F (42%)**
