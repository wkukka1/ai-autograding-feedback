# Efficiency Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This solution creates correct histograms but uses inefficient approaches:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sb = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")
view_counts = sb["view_count"].dropna()
counts, bins = np.histogram(view_counts, bins=50)
plt.hist(bins[:-1], bins, weights=counts)
plt.xlabel("View Count")
plt.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Redundant Histogram Creation**: Uses np.histogram() then plt.hist() unnecessarily
2. **Inefficient Data Processing**: Creates intermediate variables that aren't needed
3. **Complex Plotting Approach**: Overly complicated method for simple histogram
4. **Poor Resource Usage**: Unnecessary memory allocation for counts and bins
5. **Suboptimal Workflow**: Could use pandas plotting methods more efficiently

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Overcomplicated plotting**: Point out that plt.hist() can directly plot from data without np.histogram()
- **Pandas efficiency**: Suggest using pandas built-in plotting methods (.hist())
- **Code simplification**: Recommend direct approach rather than manual binning
- **Resource optimization**: Emphasize eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps
- **Best practices**: Guide toward simpler, more efficient data visualization workflows

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 95/100** - Creates correct histogram with proper bin counts
- **Style: 70/100** - Readable but unnecessarily complex structure
- **Efficiency: 40/100** - Major performance issues with redundant operations
- **Overall Grade: C (68%)**
